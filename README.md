# Notes App

## Overview

The Android Notes App is a simple, modern note-taking application built with Jetpack Compose, Kotlin Flow, and Coroutines. The app allows users to create, edit, and delete notes, storing them locally with Room Database. It follows MVVM architecture and Clean Architecture principles, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

## Key Technologies & Learnings

- **Jetpack Compose**: Building UIs declaratively using Composables, enabling a more flexible and modern approach to UI development.
- **Room Database**: Implementing local data storage with Room, providing persistence for user notes.
- **Kotlin Flow**: Handling asynchronous data streams and real-time updates in a reactive manner, making the app responsive to user interactions.
- **Coroutines**: Efficiently running background tasks for operations like database queries or data processing without blocking the main thread.
- **Material Design**: Using standardized UI components to create a polished and consistent user interface.
- **MVVM**: Structuring the app to separate UI, business logic, and data layers, allowing for better testability and easier maintenance.
- **Clean Architecture**: Organizing the app in a modular way, ensuring separation of concerns and improving code scalability and maintainability.
- **Compose Navigation**: Managing screen transitions and passing data between composables with ease.
